## 2026-10-27 — Analysis of the 2023 notes

**Done**
- Read the 2023 notes in `docs/reference/init/` (doc, xlsx with a top-orgs pivot, `ckan-list` CSV).
- Wrote `docs/ANALYSIS.md`: purpose, data model and metrics, API notes, UI spec, history, portal coverage, prior art, old roadmap status, open questions.
- Extracted the big list of CKAN instances to `docs/reference/ckan-instances.csv`: 528 links in the doc, 523 unique; plus 3 new from `ckan-list`; total 526 URLs, 519 hosts.
- Measured the legacy CSVs (rows, unique ids, empty fields). The table is in ANALYSIS.md section 2.

**Hard**
- The notes folder is gitignored, so the analysis must hold all of its content.
- The 2023 xlsx uses other column names. The mapping comes from the column contents: `versions` is `num_resources`.

**Decided**
- Extract first; set priorities in a separate step. Cost of the alternative: goals set before the full content is visible can miss items.
- All portals have equal scope; data.gov.ro is not the first focus. Cost: per-portal checks (for example "one resource = one version") must be done for each portal.
- The instance list is data, not prose, so it goes to a CSV. Nobody checked the URLs.
- Assumed, not measured: publishers add each period's file as a new resource.
